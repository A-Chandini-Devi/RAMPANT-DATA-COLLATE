# Motivation
My first ever project in programming focused on sorting and searching algorithms and data structures. The project aims to apply these concepts to the COVID-19 crisis, using data from government websites. Aim to understand information organization and retrieval through sorting and searching algorithms. This project represents a proactive engagement with contemporary issues, demonstrating the power of coding for practical problem-solving.

# ABSTRACT
The project titled "The Rampant Data Collate" is a comprehensive initiative developed using the C programming language. It addresses the urgent need for timely information on the rapidly spreading pandemic cases worldwide, providing crucial insights into the vulnerability of specific countries. The project aims to deliver an effective solution to the real-time challenges posed by the global health crisis. 

Employing a hierarchical file arrangement utilizing the tree concept of data structures, the project strategically organizes data files. The pandemic spread data for each country is systematically compiled in array formats. The cornerstone of our solution lies in the implementation of the binary search concept, enabling users to assess the risk levels in specific countries. This functionality empowers individuals to make informed decisions and take necessary precautions when planning to travel, contributing to a collective effort in managing the ongoing pandemic.

# INTRODUCTION
<b>COVID-19 Data Collection:</b> <br>
Accessing and collecting COVID-19 data from government websites can be achieved through web scraping or by downloading available datasets. Ensure you comply with any terms of use or restrictions associated with the data.
<br><br>
<b>Project Overview:</b><br>
The RAMPANT DATA COLLATE is a project crafted in the C programming language, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of pandemic cases across the globe. In the wake of the swift spread of COVID-19, this project aims to offer real-time updates on the vulnerability of various countries, derived from manually collected data from government sources.
<br><br>
<b>Functionalities:</b><br>
The project adopts a hierarchical file organization using a tree data structure. Pandemic data for each country is stored in array formats, facilitating efficient data management. Noteworthy sorting algorithms, such as Binary Search and Bubble Sort, are implemented to organize and retrieve information effectively.
<br><br>
<b>User Benefits:</b><br>
Through our project, users gain insights into the current pandemic situation in specific countries. The hierarchical structure aids in organizing data, while binary search provides a quick and efficient means to assess the risk level in a particular location. This information empowers users to take necessary precautions when navigating through affected regions.
