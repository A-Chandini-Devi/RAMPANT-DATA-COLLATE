# RAMPANT-DATA-COLLATE
C | Mini Project | A simple Data Structure Implementation

# Motivation
This is the very first project I worked on and wanted to implement few sorting and searching algorithms and Data Structure as a beginner. And explore the world of programming as my first year project of my curriculum. In this project I have tried to implement these basic concepts for an programmer on the few COVID - 19 data collected manually from the government websites those were active when we implemented it.

# ABSTRACT
This project is aimed at developing THE RAMPANT DATA COLLATE by using C programming language. Here we help you to get the updates on pandemic cases which is spreading so fast across the 
countries of the world which helps you to get the right knowledge about the vulnerability of the particular countries those u need to know. So here by we ensure an effective solution for the real time problem through our project. Here the files will be arranged in an hierarchical format where we use tree concept of data structures. Array are used to pile up the data about the pandemic spread in that country will be in the array format. The solution of our project is determined with the concept of binary search . Here by our user gets an idea about the risk 
in that particular country when he/ she reaches there which helps him/ her to take necessary precautions.

# INTRODUCTION
<b>COVID-19 Data Collection:</b> <br>
Accessing and collecting COVID-19 data from government websites can be achieved through web scraping or by downloading available datasets. Ensure you comply with any terms of use or restrictions associated with the data.
<br><br>
<b>Project Overview:</b><br>
The RAMPANT DATA COLLATE is a project crafted in the C programming language, designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of pandemic cases across the globe. In the wake of the swift spread of COVID-19, this project aims to offer real-time updates on the vulnerability of various countries, derived from manually collected data from government sources.
<br><br>
<b>Functionalities:</b><br>
The project adopts a hierarchical file organization using a tree data structure. Pandemic data for each country is stored in array formats, facilitating efficient data management. Noteworthy sorting algorithms, such as Binary Search and Bubble Sort, are implemented to organize and retrieve information effectively.
<br><br>
<b>User Benefits:</b><br>
Through our project, users gain insights into the current pandemic situation in specific countries. The hierarchical structure aids in organizing data, while binary search provides a quick and efficient means to assess the risk level in a particular location. This information empowers users to take necessary precautions when navigating through affected regions.
<br>

**KEY ALGORITHMS USED**
<ol>
  <li><b>Binary Search:</b> A fundamental search algorithm implemented for efficient retrieval of pandemic data, offering users quick access to relevant information.</li>
  <li><b>Bubble Sort:</b> Utilized as a sorting algorithm to organize the collected data systematically, ensuring ease of analysis and interpretation. </li>
  <li><b>Data Structure (Tree Concept):</b> The hierarchical arrangement of files adopts the tree concept of data structures, providing an organized framework for storing and retrieving pandemic data.</li>
  </ol>
 By implementing these a simple Data collection and accessing is being structured without the use of DataBase to understand the actuall functionality of the RDBMS and related Data Storage platforms.
 
# PROJECT WORKFLOW
<br>

> <b>Objective:</b>  Acknowledge people about the global COVID-19 situation.<br>
> <b>Goal:</b>       Provide information on the number of cases across countries.

<br>
<b>1. Information Dissemination:</b>
Displays essential precautions to guide users in managing the pandemic and present information on available vaccines and vaccination guidelines. Also list emergency contact numbers for immediate assistance.
<br><br>
<b>2. Data Presentation:</b>
Utilize a sample data set to demonstrate the functionality and implement a mechanism to show dynamic updates based on dates.
<br><br>
<b>3. Analysis and Insights:</b>
Use the data to identify trends, such as dates with the maximum and minimum cases. Provide insights into the significance of these trends.
<br><br>
<b>4. Scalability:</b> Design the project to handle larger datasets in the future. Ensure scalability for increased data volume.
<br><br>
<b>5. User Interface:</b>
Create a user-friendly interface for easy navigation. Ensure accessibility to information on precautions, vaccination, and emergency contacts.
<br><br>
<b>6. Educational Component:</b>
Provide educational content on pandemic management. Educate users about the importance of following guidelines.

# Conclusion
In summary, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the global COVID-19 situation by presenting essential information on the number of cases across various countries. Through a user-friendly interface, it offers details on precautions, vaccination guidelines, and emergency contacts. Utilizing a dynamic sample dataset, the project identifies trends, showcasing dates with the maximum and minimum cases. With scalability in mind, the design ensures adaptability to larger datasets in the future. As a call to action, we encourage users to stay well-informed, exercise caution, and adhere to recommended safety measures, fostering a collective effort to combat the ongoing pandemic.

# Future Work
Designing the project to handle larger datasets in the future and ensuring scalability for increased data volume and building a more advanced web application with Data Structures, Back End and Font End this could be presented as a functional website which could be a proto type for other websites or medical feild realted applications for handling the data needed related to the COVID pandemic patients and their future complications in health.
