# RAMPANT-DATA-COLLATE-C-Project

**ABSTRACT**

PROJECT TYPE : MINI PROJECT

This project is aimed at developing THE RAMPANT DATA COLLATE by using C programming language. 
Here we help you to get the updates on pandemic cases which is spreading so fast across the 
countries of the world which helps you to get the right knowledge about the vulnerability of 
the particular countries those u need to know. So here by we ensure an effective solution for 
the real time problem through our project. Here the files will be arranged in an hierarchical
format where we use tree concept of data structures. Array are used to pile up the data about 
the pandemic spread in that country will be in the array format. The solution of our project 
is determined with the concept of binary search . Here by our user gets an idea about the risk 
in that particular country when he/ she reaches there which helps him/ her to take necessary
precautions.

**LANGUAGES AND ALGORITHMS USED**

The Rampant data collate project implements the concept of Binary search,
bubble sort and other data structure algorithms in C language.

**PROJECT WORKFLOW**

This project's main intention is to acknowledge the people about number of COVID cases across the
countries of the world .It give some information about the precautions we must take in this
pandemic situation. Information about the vaccines and the guidelines of vaccination are clearly
mentioned in this project. The emergency contacts are mentioned in here. according to the dates,
the maximum number of cases can be seen in no time by this project is the whole intention.

This project is implemented in such a way that maximum and minimum number of cases in that respective 
date is identified from the given sample data set used which in future could be implemented in larger 
data sets.The precautions, vaccination details, guidelines and emergency numbers to contact all are
available to users similar to the COVID websites.
